If you're reading this, you're probably one of the few, if not the only person that\nI sent this link to. My name is Josh, I'm a computer scientist, and I have an undying fetish for learning.\nConsider me an inconsistent philomath. I really enjoy taking on new projects and seeing what kind of new and complex ideas I can\nexplore and apply to my next endeavor. </p>\n<p>There is no lucrative end-goal in mind when it comes to this site. There is rarely\nany money when it comes to any of my obsessive collection of computer projects. This is simply a hub\nfor my more nerdy conquests. I wanted to blog about the little things I spend time working and thinking about. What better\nway to achieve this by turning it into another little project. And so this website will be created from \"scratch\", instead of using a blogging or website creation service such as Wordpress or Wix.</p>\n<p>I look forward to pushing my rants of music, lifestyle, and technology onto unsuspecting web-surfers that happen upon this page. Especially you.</p>\n<p>Let's enjoy,\nJ</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The first post"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/test/"}}}
