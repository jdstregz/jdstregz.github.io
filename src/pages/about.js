        Hi, I'm josh, and welcome to my blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are one of my close friends, you have probably sighed at the discovery
        of this website. Those close to me are familiar with my short-lived
        writing endeavors. This time is different! But no promises.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it different? Since this time this is my own website. I have been
        peeling through music, books, projects, and other technical endeavors over
        the past 15 years, and I wanted to create a little repository where I could
        document and eloquently complain about my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will not guarantee a constant stream of content, but I am glad to say that
        this site should be in place for the indefinite future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enjoy, J
